## Quick install

```
pip install -e .[dev]
```

will install `h5grove` in editable mode with all the linting/formating/testing packages. This will also install the [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/) and [tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) packages as they are needed to build the documentation and test the project.

## Linting

- Formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- Linted with [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)
- Type-checked with [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- Checked for common security issues with [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)

All lint checks can be run with

```
invoke lint
```

Configuration entries are located in `pyproject.toml` (except for Flake8 that uses `.flake8`).

**Code is checked at each push on main and for each PR** (see `lint-test.yml` workflow).

## Tests

Tests are handled with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html). These are mostly integration tests for now that tests the responses of the endpoints of the tornado and flask example apps.

Once `h5grove` is installed in editable mode, run the tests with

```
invoke test
```

Available options (cf. `invoke --help test`):

- `-c`, `--cov-lines`: display line numbers in coverage report
- `-k [keyword]`, `--keyword [keyword]`: filter tests by keyword
- `-v`, `--verbose`: enable verbose test output

### Benchmarks

Benchmarks of different formats (`json`, `.npy`) and web server frameworks (`flask`, `tornado`) are run as part of the tests. Those benchmarks are based on [pytest-benchmark](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Benchmarks can be run with:

```
invoke benchmark
```

## Release

Versioning is handled by [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) (config in `.bumpversion.cfg`). To release a new version:

- Checkout `main` and ensure that it is up to date
- Be sure that lint checks, tests and documentation generation are passing
- Run `bump2version [patch|minor|major]`

This will create a commit increasing the version number and tag it in `git`. To trigger the PyPI release, push the commit and the tag to GitHub:

```
git push && git push --tags
```

The new tag will trigger the CI (`release.yml`) that will build and release the package on PyPI. If this succeeds, the job will also update the documentation at https://silx-kit.github.io/h5grove/ (more on this below).

Release notes can then be written in the [Releases page](https://github.com/silx-kit/h5grove/releases).

### Pre-releases

The following commands can be used to handle the pre-release cycle:
- To tag the first pre-release, run `bump2version --new-version <X.Y.Zb0> [patch|minor|major]` where `X.Y.Z` is the version number of the next release
- To bump the pre-release number, run `bump2version pre`
- To bump to the release, run `bump2version prerelease`

### Documentation

The documentation is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) by parsing Markdown files with [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The relevant files are in `docs/`:

- `conf.py`: the Sphinx configuration file
- `index.md`: Landing documentation page. It includes the `README.md`.
- `reference.md`: Generates API documentation for `content` and `encoders` modules using [sphinx.ext.autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html).

To build the documentation in development, with live reload at http://127.0.0.1:8000/, run:

```
invoke doc
```

To build the documentation once into the `_build` folder, run:

```
invoke docbuild
```
