## Using h5grove

h5grove can be used in several ways.

- To simply serve HDF5 file contents, you can look at the **[example implementations](example.md)** we provide and their **[API](api.md)**.
- You might be interested to **[add HDF5 serving capabilities into an existing application](integration.md)**
- If the [API](api.md) does not suit you, you can make use of the **[low-level modules](low_level.md)** to design your own backend, letting h5grove handle low-level tasks such as link resolution and encoding.
